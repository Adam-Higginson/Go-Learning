# Cheque Converter

Simple project which converts a number into a string cheque representation. To build, run `go build` and then execute the file that's 
generated (e.g. `./Go-Learning 562.72`) to convert the number 562.72 to cheque representation.

The algorithm is a simple recursive loop which runs from left to right through the number until the cheque format is calculated.
